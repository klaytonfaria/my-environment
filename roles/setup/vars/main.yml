# This file is kept for backward compatibility but variables have been split
# The actual loading happens in the playbook or tasks

# You can still define shared variables here if needed
shared_config:
  ansible_user: "{{ lookup('env', 'USER') }}"

# Note: Variables are now organized in:
# - homebrew.yml: Homebrew packages and casks
# - node.yml: Node.js packages
# - python.yml: Python packages
# - paths.yml: Directory paths and repository URLs
# - local.yml: User-specific overrides (gitignored)
